  # Callback methods we can implement in this Handler per http://www.ohler.com/ox/Ox/Sax.html
  #

  #
  # PROTIPs:
  # - Our callback methods must be public or they won't be called!
  # - Some argument names in the documented method definitions describe the type (in the Ruby sense)
  #   of the argument, and some argument names describe their semantic meaning w/r/t the XML document!
  #   - Arguments called `name` will be Symbols by default unless `Ox::parse_sax` was given
  #     an options hash where `:symbolize` => `false` in which case `name` arguments will contain Strings.
  #   - Arguments called `str` will be Strings always.
  #   - Arguments called `value` will be `Ox::Sax::Value` objects that can be further differentiated in several ways:
  #     http://www.ohler.com/ox/Ox/Sax/Value.html
  # - For example, an invocation of `attr(name, str)` emitted while parsing a fd.o `<magic>` Element might have
  #   a `name` argument containing the Symbol `:priority` and a `str` argument containing its String value e.g. `"50"`.
  # - The `value` versions of these callback methods have priority over their `str` equivalents
  #   if both are defined, and only one of them will ever be called,
  #   e.g. `attr_value()` > `attr()` iff `defined? attr_value()`.

      #   https://github.com/ohler55/ox/search?q=NoSkip
      # In `sax.c`'s `read_text` function they are used slightly differently in the following conditional
      # where `:skip_none` checks if the end of the Element has been reached but `:skip_off` doesn't.
