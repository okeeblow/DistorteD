    #
    #
    # I switched from `String#each_char` to `String#each_codepoint` to avoid allocating single-character Strings
    # before they could be deduplicated with `-zig`. The Integer codepoints, on the other hand,
    # will always be the same `object_id` for the same codepoint:
    #
    # rb(main):162:0> -"„ÅÇ„ÅÇ„ÅÇ".each_char { |c| p c.object_id }
    # 420
    # 440
    # 460

    # rb(main):163:0> -"„ÅÇ„ÅÇ„ÅÇ".each_codepoint { |c| p c.object_id }
    # 4709
    # 4709
    # 4709
    #
    #
    # Putting the codepoints back together with `Array#pack` is the fastest way I've found,
    # but it is mildly annoying that it won't intern the packed Strings in the C `pack_pack` code,
    # which lives here: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/pack.c
    #
    # This means that interning them here in Ruby-land forces us to eat the spurious allocation
    # and is generally slower than it needs to be, e.g. `memory_profiler` report without post-allocation interning:
    #
    #   Retained String Report

    # are now "Allocated" instead of "Retained", i.e. they will be GCed:
