I agree whole heartedly, the point of playing a video game is to have
fun.  But, borrowing from my days of playing AD&D (yes, I admit it, in
college, I played AD&D: bonus points to the person who can guess what
character I played :^), there are some people who like the challenge of
a dangerous and mind testing world, and some who like Monty Hall worlds
and invincible characters.  Personally, I liked matching witts with the
GM (I loved to frustrate him by by-passing well thought out "traps"
taking only minimal damage), but I knew of campaigns where you could
walk though hordes of giants and dragons without being hit once (we
took on a few ogres once, we spent a lot of money getting everyone
healed up again...)

But I think this is a different ballgame when you are playing "against"
other poeple, and even then I don't have a problem handicapping.  Take
the Monopoly example.  If I were playing against a younger player, I
might start them out with a few extra thousand dollars if they were
very poor players, just to give them a chance.  But then, I have thrown
games so that kids could win (just not obnoxious ones.) I had a kid
come up when I was playing _Golden Axe_ in the mall, and join in.  I'm
guessing he was between 6 and 8.  He wasn't very good at all, and I
spent most of my time getting him out of tight spots.  I carried him
through a bunch of screens he never would have got to without my help,
and he was very proud of himself afterwards (he was there with his mom,
and he was very excited to get as far as he did.)  I guess you could
argue that he didn't deserve to get as far as he did, since I carried
him, and that his progress was empty and hollow.  But it wasn't to him,
and he really had a good time doing it.  Sure, his mom and I realized
how he got there, but what difference does it make?  He got to see
stuff he couldn't have on his own, fought monsters he had never seen
before, and got his score on the high score list (_Golden Axe_ isn't
real popular in Monroville Mall).  He had fun, and isn't that what
it's all about, even if he did so with help?

Sure, I can get irritated by a braggart.  But I also realise that
people's enjoyment can come from a lot of diffrerent things, and if
someone enjoys playing CONTRA in super invincible mode with mega-death
ray enabled, who am I to tell them they can't, or they shouldn't, or
that they don't deserve to see the game's ending?  It's their money,
let them spend it way that makes them happy.

It seems to me that the newest video games are more like cartoons, and
are targeted at the youth.  Almost all have the same basic design: you
are some super being (be it a rambo-type super fighter, a mystical
ninja, a great knight, a powerful wizard, or a plumber who works for
free ;^), and you expend your energies trying to acomplish a particular
goal (free the princess, destroy the daemon, clear the sewers of creepy
crawlies).  You have a set number of screens (acts), and once it it
done, the game is over.  It seems to me it is more like an interactive
cartoon or movie than a game like poker (unless you consider some of
the "puzzle" games like Pipe Dreams, Harmony, or classical solitare
games like Ishido and Shanghai.)  Of course, they also appeal to a
different group of poeple.

Absolutely.  But then, there are very few new "games" these days (I
would consider things like Qix, Missle Command, and Pipe Dreams games,
as well as multiple player ones like Warbirds and F1 racing.)

This brings up an interesting question: when is a game really a
puzzle?  I mean, Super Mario Land (Gameboy) is a puzzle that requires
some coordination.  Dr. Mario is a game.  What is single player SF2?  A
game where you figure out how to beat certain opponents?  A puzzle with
random attributes?  Wasn't pacman just a puzzle too?

I hate to argue with two people I usually agree with, but this is
just silly.  If you don't want to use the cheat codes, don't.

If you're like me, however, and get tired of seeing the first ten
levels of Kid Chameleon over and over and over, then use the code!
(Which reminds me -- does anyone have a Kid Chameleon code?  :-)

Video games are meant to be enjoyed.  If "cheating" enhances your
enjoyment, then do it.

In any case, I think hiding these codes is a ruse to get free advertising
after a game has been available for some time.  If the game companies
would just put a darn level select on the title screen -- and maybe give
a scaled-down ending if you "cheated" your way to the end -- then we'd
all be happy.

  Point taken. I find it hard to respect someone with that mentality, but that

  Sorry to mislead you there, but I will be the first to say that I'm not a
video-gaming master of any kind.

  Perhaps that's the big driving force I have on this whole thread. It DOES
bother me when someone uses a Game Genie (or "secret" codes) to reach the
endgame, and to puff himself up as a result. I mean, your typical video game
is a contest of some kind -- you play by a set of rules, and pit your skill
in that enviroment to try and win a prize.

  The endgame should be earned, IMO, and not just given away. Without the fear
of losing, what's the point of winning? Using an invincibility code to help
you finish CONTRA III or whatever is no different from whining when you lose
at Monopoly until the other players concede and give you an extra $5000 to
continue playing.

Good example!  The whole point of playing games is to have fun, but
the word "game" also implies some sort of skill.  Nobody gives a hoot
about tic-tac-toe because a five year old can learn to force a draw
every time.  But people are still interested in chess and "go".  I
wonder why...  And lots of people seem to really enjoy chess, even
though they aren't a world power in the game.

The difference between most current video games and classic forms
of entertainment are striking.  Suppose you're playing poker with
some friends, and let's say you've never played before.  After
a while, you start to learn some little tricks.  You can't always
win--nobody can--but you can stop playing like a total incompetent.
IMO this makes it more fun, because you're not just going through
empty motions.  If all of a sudden you demand that you always
be dealt four aces then nobody is going to want to play with
you any more.  And would you only play if you knew that after
100 rounds lights would start flashing and music playing?

I still think that any game which is based solely around figuring
out some sort of solution is a puzzle, not a game.  But the
posters who recently commented on playing Lynx games for hours
during long trips, they were playing *games*.

Whatever your opinion, have fun!

Yes, this is sadly true.   LoLo and Kickle Cubicle were fun, and so was
Zelda I (and though I finished it, I enjoyed LoLo more ;^), my favorite
is still Dr. Mario (and tetris 2nd.)  I've never finished any of the Mario
series -- they just got old for me after a while.

There have been some good games coming out for the nes, though: Trog!
comes to mind almost immediately.  It's a fun game if you want to do
the mindless cute thing ;^)

The really distressing this is that it looks like the SNES will be even
more of the unimaginitive games that I have grown to dislike.  Though,
My nephew rented _Smash TV_ for his SNES (he got one yesterday for his
birthday), and I played it with him.  Great game, ut don't play it with
an obnoxious 12 year old his is better than you are, it just ain't as
much fun ;^)

Because it *is* a recreation.  And because they *enjoy* getting to the
end.  But because it is a recreation, they don't necessarily want to
invest a lot of time and energy into "beating it."  And if using a Game
Genie makes them happy, what does it matter?

A LSD is just that, a Device that Saves Labor.  It doesn't have to be
used just to help you do your chores.  There are pleanty of them used
for activities that can be strictly considered recreation: laser sights
for hunting rifles, fish finders for fishing (hell, for that matter, a
fishing reel and hunting rifle are both labor saving devices over a
hand line and a hunting bow or flintlock.)  

It is a narrow mind that sees baking as a chore and gaming as a
recreation.  They may be that you, but that does not mean that these
subjective catagorizations are the same for everyone.

I'll let you in on a lttle secret: many master bakers employ very
expensive equipment that makes their job *much* easier.  Ever seen a
Wolf oven?  Or used a K5 mixer?  Or a really good food processor?  Or
professional grade pots & pans?  Trust me when I say, these things
are the game genies of food preperation.

Wanna bet?  You don't bake much, I see.  Or, at least, you don't read
many mainstream baking magazines.  You've never seen someone toasted
as an excelent baker who' recipe is one that employs a cake mix, have
you?  These recipes (in most cases) employ little imagination over adding
an addtional ingrediant or two to an existing cake mix, or combining
two or more mixes.

And, does it matter if they consider themselves a master or not?  I was
always taught a master knows how little he knows.  You seem to imply
that you are a master (or, at least, a very skilled gamer.)  Does it
matter to you, then, if someone else claims to be a master who is not?
Does it lessen your skill, does it cheapen your achievements?  I would
say not.  You shill was gained through work, natural talent, and
perserverence.  No Game Genie can take that from you unless you let
it.

Get a clue, kiddo.  Step out into the real world for a moment and look
around, and see the kind of people who live out there.  There are a lot
of people out ther who make hollow, empty boasts about achivements that
require no skill at all, only luck and money.

What I have to wonder, given your strident defense of Ian's post, is if
your self esteem is so wound up in your ability to beat video games
that you can't deal with the thought of someone without skill being
able to beat it, or claiming to be the same level of expertice as you
seem to claim to be.  Me, I couldn't care less whether you can make
better cakes from a mix than I can from scratch; I bake because I love
to, and I enjoy baking, not gaining praise from what I accomplish (or
even bragging about it to other bakers.)

You know little about me, but you seem able to predict how I would treat
you as a baker given how you think you should treat me as a gamer.  You
have much to learn about people.

I wouldn't give you a hard time about baking a cake from a mix.  If you
made a good mix cake, I would enjoy eating it as much as I would a good
scratch cake.  And I would probably praise your efforts for it.

For me, the joy in baking come from the baking, not from pride in the
finished product.  That isn't to say that I don't take pride in a job
well done, I do, but my joy comes from know I did a good job, not
knowing how much better I did than someone else.  I'm not a competative
baker.

I can respect a master mumble, be it baker, gamer, programmer, archer,
etc.  I can respect his/her skill, his/her desire, and his/her
perserverence in mastering the area.  But I do not have to respect
arrogance, boasting, or intolerance for others.

  I expect (well, _wish_, to be more accurate) game designers to show a bit
of moral fiber and say "Nope, we won't put in a backdoor for you". Why are
the designers and programmers mollycoddling these self-serving attitudes with
the tricks?

  Then again, I suppose this would require the legions of game-churning-
crank-out-another-clone-game companies to actually take PRIDE in their work.

  Yeah. Ain't it annoying?

  Before we go further, let's distinguish something here: There's a difference
between a labor-saving device and a game cheat. A LSD is used on chores,
things that you'd rather not do anyway, and takes the difficulty away. Games
are voluntary recreation; a game cheat isn't (to me, anyway) a labor-saving
device. If you think playing SUPER MARIO 3 is a chore and you need a code to
help you "beat" it, why did you buy/rent the darn thing to begin with?

  The difference is that you wouldn't see a Mix-baker consider himself on
the same level as the master scratch-baker. You wouldn't see contestants in
cake-baking contests using mixes. Sure, I'll use a mix if I want to make a
cake, but I know when I'm outmatchd in the skill department, and can respect
the skill of the professional who whips up a seven-layer Devil's Food Cake
from scratch.

>Doing so doesn't (IMHO) make you a
>proficient baker, but if you want to call yourself that, so be it.

  Right. The question, I guess, is "Can you live with that boast?" No cook
I know would usee a mix and call himseelf a proficient baker, but IMO too
many gamers are using Genies and codes and calling themselves proficient
gamers.

  It's not just the eight-year-olds, either. I look at all the people who
replied to Ian's post with jeers and flames, calling him an elitist, and
wonder if they have some self-conscious insecurities that Ian uncomfortably
reminds them about...

  I'll bet you'll give me a hard time if I use a mix and then gloat about my
"superior skill" over your baking proficency. I dunno about Ian, but (like I
said before) I have no gripes with Genies and codes -- it's the fools who
use them to promote themselves that bug me to death.

  I agree that we should "Live and let live". But let's not forget to show
some respect to those who have earned it, whether it's the master Chef, the
master painter, or the master video-gamer.

Naturally, everyone is not or does not even want to be a master
video-gamer.  What I find silly are the people who don't even
want to put forth a meager amount of effort to learn the basic
skills involved in a particular game.  "WHAT!?!!  You mean I
have to actually PRACTICE and IMPROVE MY SKILLS!???!  The
hell with that, I want to WIN!"

Remember, the fun is supposed to be in the playing, not getting
to view some sort of ending screen.  It is unfortunate that
many games are entirely based around the latter.

So, rhis is what it boils down to, you want everyone to know you're a master
video-gamer.  I guess we'll have to take you at your word.  Tooting your
own horn is as annoying to me as someone who boasts without the ability to
back it up.  Your problem is not with the people who use the game genie, but
the fact that your "great talent" is going unrecognized.  The best thing to
do is to enter all the zillions of gaming contests to prove your skill.
Then you can have the results published in EGM, Gamepro, whatever.  

Besides, anyone who brags about beating a game with a GG hasn't got a lot
to brag about, so brush it off as immaturity.  You're above that :-)

  Now just one cotton-pickin' minuite here! When did I *EVER* say I was a
"master gamer" of any kind? Go re-read the above statement again: I think that
we, as a video-gaming public, should afford the master gamers (the guys who
can master game X without resorting to codes and cheats) with the respect they
deserve. PERIOD.

  I dare you to find a message from me where I ever boasted of any high-scores
or record-breaking accomplishments. I know my limitations, and I know when I
am outclassed on a video game (which is pretty often  B-). At least I don't
plug in a Game Genie, use the invincibility codes to finish SUPER MARIO XXIV,
then gloat about it to the net.

  (Or maybe you are just another victim of th rising tide of illiteracy in
this country...)

>Your problem is not with the people who use the game genie, but

  Bullpucky. The problem is with morons who cheat their way to the end and
then think they've acquired some kind of skill. That, and idiots who reply
to my posts without bothering to read what I've written first...

  No, Ian, you're not alone. I also make it a personal point of pride not to
use slo-mo controllers, Game Genies, or "secret" codes (secret my eye!) in the
games I play. Okay, I may use them to access a feature that you can't get
through normal play ("Do the following to see the alternate ending to
<whatever>"), but if there's a choice between the cheapo-cheat path and the
design-intended way, I'll go with the latter.

  I have nothing against the sale of cheat books, Genies, or turbo-powered
joysticks; just don't expct me to buy them. If some schmuck wants to cheat his
way to the end (whatever happened to games with no end, BTW?), that's his
loss, not mine. At least I know I have a good chance to clobber the whelp
on a straight, no-cheats-allowed head-to-head competition...

Add me to the list.  IMO the general problem with cheats and
such is that they are now required and expected and as a result
have washed out the "gaming experience."  People want to play
a game to the finish the very first night of ownership.  If they
can't, then they get frustrated and want an easy way out--and
game companies give it to them.

A few random comments:

     * If the point of a game is simply to entertain without
       requiring skill or practice or reflexes or whatever, then
       it should be DESIGNED that way from the start.  It doesn't
       make any sense to take a game that would normally require
       skill and convert it to mass entertainment by allowing
       unlimited lives, etc.  People would be happier with a
       different sort of game.

     * Some people don't have the time to devote to getting good
       at a game and just want to see the ending.  IMO then they
       are playing the wrong kind of game or shouldn't be playing
       games at all.

     * Some games are very long and starting from the beginning
       every time is ridiculous.  In this case, the game should
       provide an option to start on a higher level.  If it doesn't
       then that is poor design.

     * Too many games are based solely around getting to the end,
       There is almost no replayability on levels you have already
       seen once.

     * Many games don't give any rewards for good play execept
       getting to the end.  If you don't get to the end, you
       don't feel like you have accomplished anything.  (Video
       games could learn a few things from pinball.)

     * Hidden cheats, etc., are used for marketing purposes.
       This is a misuse of the "easter Egg" concept of being
       able to discover little secrets during the course of
       play.  Nobody accidentally discovers things like "press
       A,B,L,R,U,U,D,D,D,A,B,B to get a million lives."  It
       gives an advantage to the person who buys EGM.

     * Obviously, you can choose to ignore cheats if you want.
       But wouldn't it take something away from golf if you
       knew there was a special club which would allow any old
       man off the street to hit a hole-in-one every time?
       And it makes things worse when courses are designed
       especially for people with that club.

Game Genies are under $50, and they help even the odds for players who
aren't nearly as good as you claim to be.  And it doesn't just give
unlimited lives, it will also enable power-ups that can help a average
player get to parts of the game they might not otherwise get to.

They why in the hell do you have a little book full of them that you
saved?  You don't have to use them if you don't want to, why would you
bother to write them down???  Seem to me you are just wasting good paper.

Well, bully for you.  Do you also believe that if you can't kill your
own food with your bare hands, you don't deserve to eat?  Maybe if you
can't create your own chothing from animal hides and plant fibers, you
don't deserve to wear clothes?

Just how many labor saving devices do you have in your home?  How many
do you take for granted?  Do you use a washer & dryer, or do you use a
washboard?  Do you have a blender, mixer, or even a food processor, or
do you cut everything with a knife and mix everything with a wisk?  And
who are you to even begin to claim which ones are "right" and which
ones aren't?

Some people buy games for the entertainment value.  And if it is
entertaining for them to use a Game Genie, a super controler, etc, then
that is their business.

What irritates me is when some self-proclaimed hot-shot bozo stands up
and says crap like "people who can't get to the end of this
exceptionally challenging game based on skill alone don't deserve to
see the ending that I was so skilled enough to view".

People have different skill levels, and this self important attittude
of "well, I made it to the end, they should to" is just so much
rubbish.  Do you bake?  Do you bake well?  Could I say that you don't
deserve to eat anything that you can't prepare for yourself?  Like,
say, really good fudge, or a chocolate torte, or a really great ice
cream, or raspberry filled pasteries?  Oh, that's right, I forgot, you
pride yourself on excelling in everything, so of course you are an
exceptional baker.  You excel at everything, and buy nothing for
convenience sake.  I'll bet you even bake all of your own bread.  I'll
bet your sour dough bread is exceptional.  And I'll be the pasta that
you make from scratch (including the noodles) is even better.

> Am I the only one who says that video games should be fun?????

No, there are others who think games should be fun.  And if someone
find using a Game Genie fun, so be it.  And, if you don't like the fact
that they exist, don't buy one.  You don't have to use one.  I'd also
suggest that you throw away your little brown book -- what do you need
it for?  You excel at games.

Some people....

I do, sort of.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the Game Genie designed to make you
want to play your old games again, but with different variations,
thus creating the 1,000,000 lives, jump through your roof, fly around the
world, etc, etc...

Now once in a while, I'll pull out an old NES game, and plug in my 
Game Genie (it was a gift). And look at the different "Variations".

Say, does anyone know when the Game Genie for the Genesis will be released in
the states? <grin>

Later....

  Oh, cut him a little slack; what's the point of having rec.games.video if
we can't discuss the philosophies of the hobby, anyway?

  You have to admit, Ian has a good reason to complain. People put in
invincibility codes and make Genies because there's a demand for them. What
does that say about the self-esteem of the players who use them regularly?
How many 8-year-olds you know who read every tip in NINTENDO POWER et al,
soaking up secret tips and tricks ("Get a million coins in <name of RPG>",
"Beat so-and-so-boss using this loophole", etc.), then play game X on the
first time and proclaim himself an expert? I know plenty, and it makes me
ill to see those brainless jellyfish calling themselves "masters".

  Ian is just complaining about how he perceives that, in general, the players
of today (and tomorrow) have no adventurous backbone -- they don't care to
discover the weaknesses of the boss, they want the answers told to them. When
they're having problems getting by Stage 4 of CONTRA III, why worry about
improving your strategem when there's a secret code in EGM to give you
unlimited lives and you can bulldoze your way through?

  Like I said before (and I think Ian agrees with me), it's not the Game Genie
that's the problem, but the attitude of the players who buy the Genie. Yes,
you can use the GG to make special effects, but how many people who've bought
the darn thing specifically want it so they can get the "get to the end
easier/faster" codes?

  Problem is, how do you change people's attitudes? Beats me. Ian is right,
though -- it would be nice if the game designers reserve the TRUE rewards to
people who play "honestly". That will let the shortcut fans get to the end
quicker (and so they can return it to Blockbuster the next day and not feel
compelled to rent it again so they can finish it). Meanwhile, the ones who
played without the cheats can feel happy that they've EARNED a reward.

  Sega had a step in the right direction with the "get all of the Chaos gems
to get the REAL ending" in SONIC THE HEDGEHOG. Now if they had another ending
for people who didn't use the "select a level" secret code...

Well, well, aren't we high and mighty?  Aren't you glad you're the ultimate
gamer in the world?  As such, you don't have to worry about us piddly part-time
gamers encroaching on your territory.  I'm sorry, but aren't you taking this muctoo seriously?  There are plenty of people that don't have the time or desire
to spend the required hours to master video games (or maybe we don't have your
inbred talents).

Why do you think that the game co.'s use different skill levels on their
games?  Possibly because not everyone has your "talent"?  (Sarcasm
intentional).  There have been plenty of games that I could not finish
without the cheats.  I could have possibly finished them, but it would
have required that I send countless hours mastering the game, and I have
better things to do with my time.  VG's are great for entertainment, and
everyone approaches their entertainment in different ways.  I try to
avoid the cheats as much as possible, I don't use a fancy joystick, but
hey, I'm not one of those guys that consistently maxes out the top scores
at the back of the gaming mags.  IT"S JUST FUN!!!!  LIGHTEN UP!!!
Your attitude reminds me of the pretentious twerp in the "Why ask why?"
commercial where the guy trys to impress the girl at the art gallery, and along comes a guy that proclaims "Nachos", and walks off with the babe.  I'm a
nachos kinda guy, and while your gaming till three am, I'll be scamming
on your girlfriend in the local bar!

This is the first flame I've ever written, but I feel better now.  This one
deserved a flame.

Yes, well, they are 8-year-olds.  What do you expect?  If you are going
to expect mature behavior from an 8-year-old, a 12-year-old, even a
16-year-old, you are probably going to be disappointed.

Attitudes?  These have been changing for years, and not just in video
games.  If you think of game genies, special controllers, and cheat
codes as labor saving shortcuts, you can see we've been following this
path for years.

For example, take cake mixes.  Yup, I said cake mixes.  It used to be
that you had to make a cake from scratch (cake flour, sugar, eggs,
etc., depending on the type of cake you wanted.)  Some people took the
time to master the techniques and could bake really good cakes.  Others
made OK cakes, and bought cakes when they wanted something special.
Still others never made cakes, and bought them when they wanted one.

Then along came cake mixes.  All of the dry ingredients were
premeasured, you just had to add milk and eggs, mix, and bake.
Suddenly a lot more people could make a consistent yellow cake.  It
didn't require the effort to learn, and suddenly more people were
"baking cakes".  Some of the scratch bakers even gave up making scratch
cakes to use the mixes.  It was easier, produced the same results (a
good cake), and took a lot less time.

Now, you can buy mixes for a whole variety of cakes, and all you have
to do is add water, stir, pour into a pan, and bake.  They're great;
just about anyone can make a basic yellow, bundt, angel's food, devil's
food, etc., cake that tastes good.  Doing so doesn't (IMHO) make you a
proficient baker, but if you want to call yourself that, so be it.

You can still do it the "hard way" (which isn't really all that hard if
you take the time to learn what is going on) and make your cakes and
pastries from scratch if you are a purist (or, you like doing the
really fancy stuff).  But it is a lot more work, and if you are getting
your gratification from the finished product alone (that is, a good
tasting cake), you are probably going to be frustrated by anyone who
uses the mixes.  However, if your enjoyment comes from taking all of
separate ingredients, and though skill, perserverence, and (in some
cases) sheer force of will, create something that you can be proud of,
what difference does it make how others do it.  The joy can come from
the journey as well as from the journey's end.

My point is this: you can derive your gratification in many different
ways, and who is to say which is right and which is wrong.  While I
have spent hours and hours trying to master sculpting chocolate roses
for a cake for a dinner party (in the end, the cake took me over 20
hours to prepare, not including time spent on the roses), I'll toss a
game aside that I've flailed on for more than an hour without
progress.  I enjoy baking, and I have invested a lot of time and effort
into becoming quite good at it.  You enjoy mastering video games.  Live
and let live.  I won't give you a hard time for using a cake mix if you
don't complain when I use my nephew's game genie to beat Solstice, OK?

On a related note, my pet peev is any game that *requires* that you
know certain tricks in order to progress in a game.  If you can't find
something through normal game exploration (and with a little
imagination), then it doesn't belong in a game.  That way, I don't have
to purchase those blasted EGM-style magazines to have a prayer of
finishing a game.

And when will SEGA release Pengo in the states???

Kudos on a well-thought out post!

One note though:  a big problem is that a majority of games are
DESIGNED for people who want to use cake mixes.  That is, the only
real goal is "get to the end" and there isn't any satisfaction
in just playing for fun.

>And when will SEGA release Pengo in the states???

Pengo!  Now that would be cool.  I can hear the music

Doesn't this belong in rec.cakes?  If you've ever had a good cake made from
scratch, you will immediately realize that cake mixes don't come anywhere
close!  Telling someone that there homemade cake was as good as a cake mix
would be a real insult!  Now, back to the regularly scheduled discussion....

As far as Game Genie is concerned, I think it's a great idea.  For
instance, if Sonic the Hedgehog did not have a built in level select, I would
have finished the game and then never touched it again.  However, since it
does, I've gone back many times directly to Labyrinth, Starlight and Scrap
Brain Zones in order to find all the nooks and crannys.  Without a level
select I'd never have done this.  If Sonic did not have a built in level
select, I'd sure have liked to own the upcoming Genesis GameGenie in order
to jump to various levels.  Plus, just playing around with the thing to see
what you can make happen is interesting in itself.  Anything that adds play
value to an already existing game is a good idea.

Steve

I'll come right out and say that I'm apalled at the apparent popularity of
"Game Genie" (for NES, you know, gives you unlimited lives, skips to any level, etc.).  For one thing, lots of games have similar codes built in to them (e.g. Konami code, U-U-D-D-L-R-L-R-B-A-Start) which give the same results.  Believe me, I have a little brown book full of controller codes, maps, etc. and more often than not, any given game will have some secrets with it.  So why buy a little device that does that for you for who knows how much?

Furthermore, I'd like to add that I don't believe in the controller codes either;  I think that if you don't have enough skill to beat a game the way it was designed to be played, then you don't deserve to see the ending period. Maybe something like if the game checks at the end to see if you did any "cheating" during the game, and if you did you get a screen saying "next time, beat this game the real way, and you'll see a REAL ending."  That would be okay.  But I haven't met the game that I couldn't beat 


without controller codes.

I also feel the same way about special controllers that have rapid fire, slow motion, etc.  If you don't have the skill to beat the game, you practice until you're good enough to do it.  Unfortunately, in today's world, the general idea seems to be that if you don't have the skill to beat the game, you go out and buy $100 worth of equipment to beat the game for you.  I'm sorry, but that's just not right.  And what's worse is that people are actually BUYING these products, so companies make more of them.

I make it a point to excel in everything I do, video games included, and it gets me very angry when someone who obviously has no skill goes out and buys a product which allows them to do everything that I could with just pure skill. (the least they could do is pay ME the money to beat it for them <grin> ).  But seriously, why buy a game in the first place if you're not going to be challenged by it?  Isn't that what's so fun about games in the first place? That they're challenging?

Does anyone out there feel the same way I do?  Please, let me know that I'm not alone in this cruel, crazy-mixed-up world where arcade games are shrunk down to a size you can put in your pockets, and devices are made which take the challenge and fun out of those games.  Am I the only one who says that video games should be fun?????
