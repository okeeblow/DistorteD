  # Test a Pathname representing an extant file whose contents and metadata we can use.

  # an extant path, or even raw stream contents. It could be given a Pathname representing
  # either a hypothetical or extant file. It could be given an IO/Stream object.

  # Some of this complexity is my fault, since I'm doing a lot of variable juggling
  # to avoid as many new-Object-allocations as possible in the name of performance
  # since this library is the very core-est core of DistorteD;
  # things like assigning Hash values to single CYO objects the first time that key is stored
  # then replacing that value with a Set iff that key needs to reference any additional CYO.

  # - `::from_xattr` can return `nil` or a single `CYO` depending on filesystem extended attributes.
  #   It is very very unlikely that most people will ever use this, but I think it's cool 8)

  #   separately from freeform globs since file-extension matches are the vast majority of globs.
  #   Postfixes avoid needing to be weighted since they all represent the same final pathname component
  #   and should never result in multiple conflicting Postfix key matches.
  #   A single Postfix key can represent multiple CYOs, though; hence the possible `Set`.
  #
  # - `::from_glob` can return `nil` or `Hash` since even a single match will include the weighted key.
  #
  # - `::from_content` can return `nil` or `Hash` based on a `libmagic`-style match of file/stream contents.
  #   Many common types can be determined from the first four bytes alone, but we support matching
  #   arbitrarily-long sequences against arbitrarily-big byte range boundaries.
