# This file defines various utility Modules/procs/etc that should be available
# to all other CYO components without `including`.
# This lets be declutter the other Modules and also serves the practical purpose
# of letting me silence `Warning`s like the one for using Ruby 2.7's pattern matching syntax.
# Defining `Warning[:experimental] = false` does not silence Warnings further in to the same file,
# so affected procs have to exist at least one level past CYO's library entry point file.

  # The following two `proc`s handle classwide-memoization and instance-level assignment
  # for values that may be Enumerable but often refer to only a single Object.
  #
  # For example, most `Postfix`es (file extensions) will only ever belong to a single CYO Object,
  # but a handful represent possibly-multiple types, like how `.doc` can be an MSWord file or WordPad RTF.
  #
  # These assignment procs take a storage haystack, a needle to store, and a CYO receiver the needle refers to.
  # They will set `haystack[needle] => CYO` if that needle is unique, or they will convert
  # an existing `haystack[needle] => CYO` assignment to `haystack[needle] => Set[existingCYO, newCYO]`.

  # as few spurious objects as possible instead of explicitly initializing a Set for every needle.
