  # Configure DistorteD format changes by media_type, then by sub_type.
  # The list of target formats is plain text, media_type/sub_type.
  # These are mostly based on IANA's official Media Types list:
  # https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
  # but with some custom additions like using 'gif-sequence' for
  # animated GIF and leaving 'image/gif' to refer to single-frame GIFs.
