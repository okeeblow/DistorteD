# COOLTRAINER::DistorteD

DistorteD is a multimedia toolkit comprised of several related but standalone components:
- [`CHECKING YOU OUT`](https://rubygems.org/gems/checking-you-out) is DD's file-type identification library à la `ruby-mime-types`, `filemagic`, `marcel`, etc.
- [`DistorteD-Jekyll`](https://rubygems.org/gems/distorted-jekyll) contains anything and everything that relates to markup generation and Jekyll integration.
- [`DistorteD-Floor`](https://rubygems.org/gems/distorted) — a.k.a. just 'DistorteD' — contains media format conversion routines and a CLI to use them.
- [`DistorteD-Booth`](https://rubygems.org/gems/distorted-booth) is a very early proof-of-concept DD GUI that isn't very interesting or useful yet :)
- [`XROSS THE XOUL`](https://rubygems.org/gems/xross-the-xoul) contains routines for cross-CPU / cross-OS / cross-Desktop / etc portability.

## Motivation

DD is my solution for displaying photos, videos, and other types of media on [cooltrainer.org](https://cooltrainer.org) due to my dissatisfaction with every other solution I could find.
