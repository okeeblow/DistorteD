# Cooltrainer::DistorteD

`DistorteD-Ruby` is the core file-handling code for `DistorteD-Jekyll`.

## Installation

Add this line to your site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'distorted'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install distorted


## Development

Clone the DistorteD repository and modify your Jekyll `Gemfile` to refer to your local path instead of to the newest published version of the gem:

```
gem 'distorted', :path => '~/repos/DistorteD/DistorteD-Ruby/'[, :branch => 'NEW-SENSATION']
```
